# BUAAHND_G3T1_SDDS

This project contains code written for practising the knowledge gained from the course **Software Development: Data Structures** during Term 1 of Grade 3 in BUAA.

## ATTENTION

1. By 18 February 2020, everything looks good with VS Code + C++ 20 or VS 2019 + .NET Framework 4.7.2 (Outcome\Exercise4_CSharp).
2. Remember to check the path of the compiler (MinGW-w64) in ".vscode\launch.json" before debugging.
